# Object-based Logo Interpreter

Interpreter for a language invented by me that can be compared to the known [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)), but with the syntax and operating principles more similar to the current object-based languages. Project also contains IDE that enables user to write the code and shows the results (movements of turtles) on canvas.
